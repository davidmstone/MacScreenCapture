# MacScreenCapture - 01/08/2015

Free and all that stuff.

Apple Script which creates capture folder on desktop and takes regular screen shots of the users machine using the terminal screencapture command through OSX applescript.

I have compiled this into an APP, which can be placed in the start up applications allowing the user to install the APP which takes regular screen shots at 60 second intervals. 

Following every 45 days older files are automatically deleted and placed in the TRASH. 

Both options can very easily be modified - ie, regular nature of screen capture as well as the duration they are placed in the bin.
